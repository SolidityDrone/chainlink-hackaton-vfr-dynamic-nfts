# chainlink-hackaton-vfr-dynamic-nfts

SVG-ARENA, we're experimenting with code in Remix right now, testing will be done asap using either brownie or foundry. 
For now the main contract mints nft with random stats using mint. For lazyness just a string and a number untill we figure out the game mechanics.
After main contract and the ERC20 are deployed, you can deploy StakingNFT giving those 2 contracts as argument and it will handle nft stakings.
The main goal is learning, ofc. The second goal is a full-onchain game with upgradable dynamic nfts using polygon network and vrf.
